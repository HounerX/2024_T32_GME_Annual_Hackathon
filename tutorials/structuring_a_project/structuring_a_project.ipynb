    "# Structuring a project\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting any new coding project, taking some time to appropriately structure your coding environment **WILL** save you headaches in the future!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through **four** concrete aspects of structuring your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Version control\n",
    "2. Folder/Directory Structure\n",
    "3. Tracking dependencies\n",
    "4. Workflow management\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: There are **MAAANY** different ways to structure your project. For example, [workflowr](https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr) is a framework developed at UChicago. It combines git (version control), with its own enforced directory structure to keep the user's R analysis project organized. There are literally dozens of different software available for each aspect of structuring your project. Choosing and learning the ones you like is part of the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is not to pidgeon-hole you into using a specific prebuilt framework. Instead, I will encourage you all to structure things **yourself**. This will develop good organizational habits, and if done correctly will make it **trivial** to port your code to frameworks like workflowr, snakemake, etc. when the time is right. "

    "Version control is extremely important. It will let you create backups of your code, keep track of progress over time, give others trust in the reproducibility of your code, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a widely used open-source version control software. Almost all major open-source projects are hosted on github, a website which provides a nice interface to git repositories. Git itself can be a little bit cumbersome and confusing. If you really want to be an expert, I recommend reading [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Because the hackathon code is hosted on github, we will be using git/github here. \n",

    "Documentation on \"forking\" can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks). The nice thing about forking is that you get your own \"version\" of this repository. You can make changes freely in that version without altering the original, and when the time is right the original repository can be updated with your changes.\n",

    "Note: You can check which files are currently stages with:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> git status </code>\n",

    "2.) Commit all staged changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> git commit -m \"Your commit message\" </code>\n",

For example, if you are planning on eventually creating an R package to be hosted on CRAN (\"Comprehensive R Archive Network‚Äù) then there may be some rules you need to obey. One helpful idea is to just look up the code from an existing R package you wish to emulate. Here is an example from the single-cell analysis software Seurat:\n",

    "\n",
    "Personally I find this the most difficult part of structuring a project. The idea is to keep track of all the required packages, libraries, programming languages, etc. needed to be able to reproducibly run your code. Unfortunately, it only takes the wrong version of a single package to \"ruin\" your ability to run the code on a different machine. For this reason, a variety of solutions exist for keeping meticulous track of project dependencies. From virtual environments, containers, automation engines, etc. the list goes on.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the biological sciences, most of you have probably heard of a workflow management framework called [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/). Snakemake let's you create reproducible, automated pipelines and provides a laundry list of helpful features. The only stipulation is that it requires you to specify your pipeline following Snakemake's guidelines which, while not overly complicated, do take some time to get accustomed to. For R users, Snakemake also uses python-like syntax, providing an additional barrier to rapid adoption. \n",

I will show a very basic strategy which can let you hit the ground running, while also making later adoption to a workflow management framework a breeze. **I highly recommend using a workflow management framework once you are ready to run at scale or publish to a wide audience!**\n"

    "Having all your code in one long script is, unsurprisingly, an unstable solution. Ideally, you want the code split into discrete steps which make sense, and code organized to reduce redundancy. For example, if you have commonly used functions among all your scripts, you should put them in their own files to be imported when needed. \n",
