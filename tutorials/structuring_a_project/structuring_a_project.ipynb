    "\n",
    "Before starting any new coding project, taking some time to appropriately structure your coding environment **WILL** save you headaches in the future!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through **four** concrete aspects of structuring your project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Version control\n",
    "2. Folder/Directory Structure\n",
    "3. Tracking dependencies\n",
    "4. Workflow management\n",
    "\n",
    "One last point. There are **MAAANY** different ways to do the above. For example, [workflowr]{https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr} is a framework developed at UChicago. It combines git (version control), with its own enforced directory structure to keep the user's R analysis project organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is not to pidgeon-hole you into using a prebuilt framework. Instead, I will encourage you all to structure things **yourself**. This will develop good organizational habits, and if done correctly will make it **trivial** to port your code to frameworks like workflowr, snakemake, etc. when the time is right. "
